"""Jijiga AO Monthly Monitoring Automation Engine v1

Purpose
-------
Read one or more MoDa XLSX/CSV exports, standardize a controlled set of monitoring
indicators, generate site-level findings, aggregated management actions, and a data
quality audit package.

Design principles
-----------------
1. Derive reporting month from monitoring date, not manually selected Monitoring Month.
2. Match fields by exact/approved question text aliases, never Excel column position.
3. Keep respondent/site-observation denominators explicit.
4. Generate proposed findings only; field validation and management agreement remain human gates.
5. Do not silently calculate an indicator when its mapped source field is missing.

This core engine deliberately writes canonical CSV/JSON outputs. Formatted XLSX trackers
are built from these canonical files by the companion artifact-tool workbook builder.
